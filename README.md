## Introduction

This portfolio website is built using React and showcases various projects I have worked on. Each project card provides a brief description, the technologies used, and links to the project's GitHub repository and live demo (if available).

## Features

- **Dynamic Typing Effect**: The hero section features a dynamic typing effect that cycles through different programming languages.
- **Project Cards**: Each project is displayed as a card with a hover effect that reveals more details.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and animations enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling the components.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for the web.
- **HTML**: Markup language for creating web pages.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/husainwafaie/Personal-Website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Personal-Showcase
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
